note:
* the behaviour we'll use as a "source of truth" is that of an unenhanced Apple IIe, with a revision B mainboard, and an extended 80 column text card

---

future:
* debug the BASIC crash?
* another possible angle could be to debug individual monitor IO routines,
  one at a time, and check that they have the intended behaviour.
    * see the TRM, page ~62 for ROM routine docs
* or, get Rust toolchain up&running, and write some small demos/games

---

more soft switches:
* bank switching
* then do a refactor of the soft switch code

hardware features:
* inverse text glyphs
* blinking glyphs
