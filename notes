note:
* the behaviour we'll use as a "source of truth" is that of an unenhanced Apple IIe, with a revision B mainboard, and an extended 80 column text card

---

future:
* debug the BASIC crash?
* another possible angle could be to debug individual monitor IO routines,
  one at a time, and check that they have the intended behaviour.
    * see the TRM, page ~62 for ROM routine docs
* or, get Rust toolchain up&running, and write some small demos/games

---

more soft switches:
/ first do a refactor of the soft switch code
/ test it
* then impl bank switching

hardware features:
* inverse text glyphs
* blinking glyphs

**************************************************************
* (UPDATE): it's been a long time since I've worked on this,
* and I think some stuff is broken, so maybe best thing to do
* is get a simple "hello world" program before moving forward.
* And if that doesn't work as expected there's a good chance
* that things were broken in the most recent commit, so try
* again on a slightly older commit as well.

left off:
[ ] impl setting values in the debugger
[ ] use this fxnality to set
        c511: 3f
    so that the ROM self-test skips the
    "die" due to un-impl'd soft switches
    and proceeds to run the other tests
[ ] see what happens. Then decide what to
    work on next.
    > we'll have bugs in the bank-switching code
        to test and fix...
