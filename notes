next steps:
* maybe hand-write a trivial "echo" program to test keyboard / screen
    > the goal is to be simpler than BASIC and sysmon, and thus easier
      to debug
* another possible angle could be to debug individual monitor IO routines,
  one at a time, and check that they have the intended behaviour.
    * this seems more tractable than just single-stepping the sysmon code
