next steps:
* maybe hand-write a trivial "echo" program to test keyboard / screen
    > the goal is to be simpler than BASIC and sysmon, and thus easier
      to debug
* another possible angle could be to debug individual monitor IO routines,
  one at a time, and check that they have the intended behaviour.
    * this seems more tractable than just single-stepping the sysmon code
    * see the TRM, page ~62 for ROM routine docs
* or maybe we just debug the BASIC crash? I mean, how hard can it be...

interlude: implement a more useful debugger
* start by just impl'ing "halt", as a "hello world"
* then think about how to structure the code
    * e.g.: 1. parse command; 2. execute command
* write down the steps, in order, you'll do to impl the MVP
    (h, c, b, s)
