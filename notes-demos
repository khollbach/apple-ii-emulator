list of demos, with any features that we've noticed are missing, to make them run

logos (nice!)

tunnel (seems to work fine)

colors (looks good)

chess (looks gooood)

ascii (looks fine)
  (bonus:)
    impl display of extra glyphs: (see github gif)
    * blinking
    * inverse
    * extra copy of upper alpha

reverse
    * After preventing stores to c000 from modifying its value,
      these issues appear to be fixed:
        * getting an extra '>' prompt char
        * once you've scrolled off the bottom, the prompt starts auto-repeating

---

guess-the-number (seems to work)

ghosts (seems good!)

sokoban (yes!)

snake (mixed mode impl'd!)
    * there's still some bank switching that we haven't properly impl'd yet
